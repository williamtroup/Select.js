# Select.js - Change Log:

## Version 0.2.0:
- Added a new binding option "dropDownShowDelay" (defaults to 50), which states the millisecond that it should wait before showing the drop-down menu.
- Fixed a fault that cause the drop-down menu to remain open when clicking in the main control again.
- Added a new binding option "showDropDownButton" (defaults to true), which states if a opening/closing button should be used for showing the drop-down menu.
- Internal cleanups to make passing DOM element object around a bit easier.
